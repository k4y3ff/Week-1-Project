Week 1 Project
===============

After you unzip the folder 'original_files.zip', ex1.py will create 26 directories in its current directory (one for each letter of the alphabet), then move each file in 'original_files' to its proper directory, dependent on the first character of its filename.

For example, the file 'artichoke.txt' would go into the directory 'a', 'bartholomew.txt' would go into 'b', etc.
